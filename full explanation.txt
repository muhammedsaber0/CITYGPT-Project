Full Detailed Explanation of the System
Your system is an intelligent, interactive traffic simulation platform that allows a user to describe a trip in natural language, automatically simulate that trip on a real city map (like Seattle‚Äôs Montlake area), block roads, and observe how traffic performance changes. It combines AI, geographic data, traffic simulation, and backend APIs into one cohesive workflow.

‚úÖ 1. User Input Stage (Natural Language Command)
The system starts when a user types a sentence into the chatbot interface such as:

"I want to walk from Pike Place Market to Seattle Center for recreation."

This is sent to the FastAPI backend through a POST request to:

bash
Copy
Edit
/generate-scenario
‚úÖ 2. Trip Understanding via Gemini AI
Your Python backend (simulator.py) takes that natural language and calls Gemini AI, which extracts the key structured elements from the sentence:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "origin": "Pike Place Market",
  "destination": "Seattle Center",
  "mode": "Walk",
  "purpose": "Recreation"
}
This makes the system conversational and user-friendly, removing the need for manual configuration.

‚úÖ 3. Geocoding Origin and Destination
After extracting the origin and destination names, the system calls the Nominatim API (from OpenStreetMap) to convert those names into geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). These coordinates are needed to place the trip accurately on the A/B Street simulation map.

‚úÖ 4. Scenario Generation
With structured trip data and coordinates, the system creates a simulation scenario JSON that describes:

The trip's origin and destination (as coordinates)

The departure time

The mode of transportation (Drive, Bike, Walk)

The trip purpose (Work, Meal, Recreation)

This scenario is saved as:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
generated_abstreet_script.json
‚úÖ 5. Scenario Import into A/B Street
Using the A/B Street CLI tool, the saved JSON scenario is imported into the map file:

swift
Copy
Edit
data/system/us/seattle/maps/montlake.bin
This converts it into a .bin scenario file that A/B Street can simulate.

‚úÖ 6. Running the Simulation (Headless Mode)
Your code then loads the binary scenario into the A/B Street simulator (running in "headless" mode, meaning no GUI). It tells A/B Street to simulate traffic for a realistic amount of time (1 hour after the last trip departure time).

‚úÖ 7. Returning Roads to Frontend
After the simulation is done, the system calls:

python
Copy
Edit
fetch_road_thruput()
This function fetches the roads that were used by the trip(s), including road IDs. Then:

python
Copy
Edit
fetch_road_details()
retrieves their names, lanes, and structure so the frontend can let the user select which roads to block.

At this point, the system sends back to the frontend a list of affected roads in human-readable form so the user can make decisions:

‚ÄúWhich roads do you want to close?‚Äù

‚úÖ 8. Blocking Roads and Rerunning Simulation
When the user selects roads to block, the frontend sends those road IDs to:

bash
Copy
Edit
/simulate-with-blocked-roads
Then:

Your backend fetches the current configuration of each road

Removes all lanes (representing a closure)

Sends this new edited version of the map to A/B Street

Reloads the scenario with the edited roads

Reruns the simulation again with those changes

This models what happens if those roads are closed.

‚úÖ 9. Collecting Simulation Results
After rerunning, your system fetches detailed traffic performance metrics:

Average Travel Time

Maximum Delay

Number of Trips Completed

These metrics are then saved in a PostgreSQL database, along with:

The map used

The blocked road IDs

The original user input

The date and time of the run

This allows for long-term tracking and comparison of traffic outcomes.
